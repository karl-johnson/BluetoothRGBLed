# BluetoothRGBLed
  Arduino and Android code to control an RGB LED over bluetooth.
  This isn't interesting in itself but this repo serves as a test for:
  - Instruction and XOR-checksum based serial comm protocol over bluetooth
  - Managing both Arduino and Android code in one repo (crucial for instruction consistency between devices)
  - Getting certain UI elements (joystick, toggles, etc) to work in Android app
  
  Hopefully, once figuring out these things, these principles will transfer to making a motorized panoramic tripod head controller app.
